# Installation Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of installing and setting up the NetSec Monitoring Stack.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

*   **Git:** To clone the repository.
*   **Docker:** To run the services in containers.
*   **Docker Compose:** To manage the multi-container application.

## 2. Hardware Requirements

The hardware requirements for this stack will vary depending on the number of devices you are monitoring and the amount of network traffic being analyzed. Here are some general guidelines:

### Small Deployment (e.g., home lab, small office with < 20 devices)

*   **CPU:** 2-4 cores
*   **RAM:** 4-8 GB
*   **Storage:** 50-100 GB SSD

### Medium Deployment (e.g., small to medium business with 20-100 devices)

*   **CPU:** 4-8 cores
*   **RAM:** 16-32 GB
*   **Storage:** 200-500 GB SSD

### Large Deployment (e.g., enterprise with > 100 devices)

*   **CPU:** 8+ cores
*   **RAM:** 32+ GB
*   **Storage:** 1TB+ SSD

## 2. Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and clone the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/boniyeamincse/netsec-monitoring-stack.git
cd netsec-monitoring-stack
```

### Step 2: Run the Automated Setup Script

The project includes an automated setup script that will configure the environment and start all the services. Run the script with the following command:

```bash
./scripts/init.sh
```

This script will perform the following actions:

*   **Check for dependencies:** It will verify that Docker and Docker Compose are installed.
*   **Create environment files:** It will copy the `.env.example` files to `.env` files.
*   **Generate passwords:** It will automatically generate secure, random passwords for all the services and update the environment files.
*   **Start all services:** It will use the `Makefile` to start all the Docker containers in the correct order.

## 3. Post-Installation

### Accessing the Web Interfaces

Once the setup script is complete, the services will be running in the background. You can access the web interfaces for the various tools at the following URLs (replace `<server-ip>` with the IP address of your server):

*   **Wazuh Dashboard:** `http://<server-ip>:5601`
*   **LibreNMS:** `http://<server-ip>:8000`
*   **NetBox:** `http://<server-ip>:8001`
*   **ntopng:** `http://<server-ip>:3000`
*   **Oxidized:** `http://<server-ip>:8888`
*   **TheHive:** `http://<server-ip>:9000`
*   **Cortex:** `http://<server-ip>:9001`
*   **MISP:** `https://<server-ip>:8443`
*   **Grafana:** `http://<server-ip>:3001`

### Default Credentials

*   **Grafana:** `admin` / `admin`
*   **Other services:** The passwords for other services (like LibreNMS and NetBox) are automatically generated by the setup script and can be found in the `env/*.env` files.

### Managing the Services

You can use the `Makefile` to manage the services:

*   **Check the status of all services:** `make ps`
*   **View the logs of all services:** `make logs`
*   **Stop all services:** `make down-core && make down-flows && make down-ids && make down-soc && make down-ti && make down-grafana`

## 4. Troubleshooting

*   **Permission denied when running `init.sh`:** If you get a permission denied error, make sure the script is executable: `chmod +x scripts/init.sh`
*   **Ports are already in use:** If you have other services running on the same ports, you can change the ports in the `.env` file before running the setup script.


ðŸ‘¥ Team Practices

Use Git branching model: main (stable) / dev (work in progress).

All changes go through Pull Requests with at least one reviewer.

Keep secrets out of git (env/*.env).

Run make lint before committing to validate YAML/Markdown.
